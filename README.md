# Recipe Book

This is my first HTML project as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

In this project, I’ve built a basic webpage using only HTML. It contains a heading, some paragraphs, and links. I’ve also practiced file structure, proper indentation, and using Git for version control.

Once completed, this project will demonstrate my ability to:
- Set up a basic HTML document
- Use heading and paragraph tags
- Link to external sites
- Use Git to track changes and push to GitHub
